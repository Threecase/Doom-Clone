NOTE:
 * In Doom, the polygons are made up of subsectors in the map.


BSP Tree Generation:
 1. Choose a polygon P from the list.
 2. Create a node N in the tree, add P to N.
 3. For every other polygon in the list:
   1. If that polygon is totally in front of P, add
      that polygon to the list of polygons in front of P.
   2. If that polygon is totally behind P, add that
      polygon to the list of polygons behind P.
   3. If that polygon intersects P, split it into 2 polygons
      and add them to the proper lists. (ie in front or behind)
   4. If that polygon is in the same plane as P, add
      it to N.
 4. Apply the algorithm to polygons in front of P.
 5. Apply the algorithm to polygons behind P.



BSP Tree Traversal:
 1. If current node is a leaf (ie has no children), render it.
 2. Else, if the viewing location V is is front of N:
   1. Render nodes behind N
   2. Render polygons at N
   3. Render nodes in front of N
 3. Else, if V is behind N
   1. Render nodes in front of N
   2. Render polygons at N
   3. Render nodes behind N
 4. Else, V is precisely on the N plane
   1. Render nodes in front of N
   2. Render nodes behind N
