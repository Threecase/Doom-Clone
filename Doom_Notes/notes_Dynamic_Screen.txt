Dynamic Screen (used for efficient front-to-back rendering):

    STRUCTURE:
     An array of pointers to scanline lists.

     Each scanline list is a list of available (ie not already
     rendered) pixels.

     Scanline list has 3 fields: min, max, and a pointer to the next
     element. Min and max are the range of available pixel
     coordinates at each segment.

     Initially, each linked list in DS has just one segment: the
     entire scanline of pixels.

    DRAWING:
     1. Iterate through each scanline.
     2. For each pixel range to be drawn, compare to the list of
        available pixels.
     3. If there are available pixels in the range to be drawn, draw
        the pixels, then remove the range of drawn pixels from the
        available pixel list.
