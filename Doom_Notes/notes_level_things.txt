Thing: A structure which contains:
    x and y coords,
    angle,
    thing type,
    flags.

FLAGS (can be or'd together):
    0x01 : Thing is on skill levels 1 and 2
    0x02 : Thing is on skill level 3
    0x04 : Thing is on skill levels 4 and 5
    0x08 : Thing is deaf
    0x10 : Thing is not in single player

----

Linedefs: A structure which contains:
    start and end vertices,
    flags,
    special type, (?)
    sector tag,
    right and left sidedef

FLAGS (can be or'd together):
    0x0001 : blocks player + monsters
    0x0002 : blocks monsters
    0x0004 : two sided
    0x0008 : upper texture is unpegged (it is attached to the ceiling)
    0x0010 : lower texture is unpegged (it is attached to the floor)
    0x0020 : secret area
    0x0040 : blocks sound
    0x0080 : doesn't appear on automap
    0x0100 : always appears on automap

----

Sidedefs: Structure containing wall texture data. Contains:
    texture x/y offset
    name of upper, lower, middle textures
    sector number

(NOTE: upper texture - the texture that is displayed between
    ceilings of differing heights)

(NOTE: middle texture - the texture in the middle of the wall)

(NOTE: lower texture - the texture that is displayed between
    floors of differing heights)

----

Vertex: A pair of signed 16-bit numbers. Contains:
    x and y coords

----

Seg: Segments of Linedefs. These are used in BSP, when a linedef
      needs to be split. Contains:
    Start + end vertex,
    Angle,
    Linedef
    Direction (ie left/right side of linedef)
    Offset (?)

----

Subsector: Autogenerated by BSP: is a list of Segs that make up a
    closed polygon. These are used in the BSP as the polygons to
    render.

----

Node: Contains:
    x and y coords of partition line,
    deltaX and deltaY of partition line,
    right and left bounding box (represented by 4 ints)
    right and left children

----

Sector: A sector is referenced by sidedefs, and stores general data
        about a region or regions. Contains:
    Floor and ceiling height,
    Name of floor and ceiling texture,
    Light level,
    Type,
    Tag number (?)

TYPES:
     0 : Normal (no special effects)
     1 : Light blinks randomly
     2 : Light blinks every 0.5s
     3 : Light blinks every 1.0s
     4 : 20% dps + light blinks every 0.5s
     5 : 10% dps
     7 : 5% dps
     8 : Light oscillates
     9 : Secret area
    10 : 30s after level start, ceiling lowers
    11 : Cancels God mode, 20% dps, end level when player dies
    12 : Light blinks every 0.5s, syncronized
    13 : Light blinks every 1.0s, syncronized
    14 : 300s after level start, ceiling rises
    16 : 20% dps
    17 : Light flickers randomly

----

Reject Table: A lookup table used to determine if there is a possible
    line-of-sight for a monster in a certain sector. It is an array
    of boolean values, if 1, there is no possible LOS; otherwise,
    the game must calculate if the monster can see the player.

----

Blockmap: Collision mapping for a small area of the map, used to make
    collision detection faster. Contains:
    HEADER:
     x and y coords of block
     number of cols and rows in the block
    OFFSETS:
     offset to block 0
     offset to block 1
     ...
     offset to block N (cols*rows)
    BLOCKLIST:
     0x0000
     Linedef 0 in block
     Linedef 1 in block
     ...
     0xFFFF (-1)
